[Concept Creator](https://twitter.com/cconceptcreator?lang=en){:target="_blank"} is back at it again with fresh take on the upcoming Series 4 Apple Watch. The primary change is the increase in display size, this is something that has been rumored all the way back in March by [Ming-Chi Kuo](https://9to5mac.com/2018/03/27/new-apple-watch-larger-screen-series-4/){:target="_blank"} on 9To5Mac. If true, this will be the first departure from the original design introduced over 3 years ago.

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.21%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1VI1qubRimA?ecver=2" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" width="641" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

If the display size does end up getting increased by the rumored 15%, I am curios how this will impact battery performance. Will the next [SOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip){:target="_blank"} be able to make up for the display power draw increase?

If the last two Apple Watch releases are any indicators on timing, we should find out come late September.
