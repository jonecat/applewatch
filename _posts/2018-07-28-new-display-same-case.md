As the time of the new Apple Watch draws closer, the flood gates of rumors for it starts to open up.

The latest news we are hearing comes from [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2018/07/27/apple-watch-series-4-specs-price-release-date/){:target="_blank"}, they are saying that we are going to see an increase in the size of the display of 15% over the previous generations. What's different is it appears we are not going to see any change in case size, they should still come in at 38mm and 42mm. So this will be more in alignment with the iPhone X of having a near edge to edge display.

We also keep hearing this rumor about solid state buttons, I am not sure how this will change the digital crown, but I imagine this should help increase the weather resistance even more over the Series 3.
