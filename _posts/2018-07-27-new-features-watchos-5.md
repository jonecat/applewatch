We all know that WatchOS 5 is fast approaching. While we wait, I found a great video by the guys over at [Apple Insider](https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/06/08/65-new-features-in-watchos-5-for-apple-watch) that goes over a lot of new features that are available in the WatchOS 5.

One notable missing feature I would loveâ€¦ 3rd party watch faces! Apple please make this a thing!!!
